      "This report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Department of Industry and \n",

      "over its New Forest Project (Mt Aubrey tenement E09/1004) in the Murchison Region of Western \n",
      "Australia, 130km north of Mullewa and 520km north of Perth.  The reporting period is from the 26 \n",
      "September 2005 to the 25 September 2006. \n",
      " \n",
      "No ground disturbing fieldwork was undertaken within the tenement during the reporting period since \n",
      "Midwest was only successful in obtaining a signed Heritage Agreement from the Yamatji Land and Sea \n",
      "Council part the way through the reporting period. Additionally, a series of cyclonic events in the \n",
      "northwest of Western Australia, left large areas adjacent to the Murchison River catchment (including \n",
      "the New Forest Project area) virtually impassable for the months between January and April 2006. \n",
      " \n",
      "The New Forest iron ore mineralisation occurs as highly weathered, outcropping bands of haematite and \n",
      "quartz-haematite mineralisation within Archaean banded iron formations on either side of the Murchison \n",
      "River.  The majority of BIF outcrops known from the New Forest Project are located around Morrissey \n",

      "in 1968 (Baxter, et al. 1968), the only exploration for iron ore within New Forest region was undertaken \n",
      "during the late 1990’s by Kingstream Steel Ltd (later Midwest), as a potential adjunct to other iron \n",
      "resources at Tallering Peak and Weld Range. In June 2000, Kingstream commissioned Exploration and \n",
      "Mining Consultants (EMC) to conduct a preliminary investigation of potential iron ore mineralisation in \n",
      "and around New Forest (Johnston & Batten, 2000), which identified Morrissey within E70/2237 as the \n",
      "most promising area within the tenement for further study.  \n",

      "In addition to iron ore, the New Forest area has also been explored for gold by Stockdale Prospecting \n",

      "by Richmond Resources Pty Ltd (Richmond, 1998). Other, older records of exploration for base metals, \n",

      "migmatised sedimentary and volcanic sequences, overlain extensively by Cainozoic regolith (Baxter, \n",
      "1974).  Morrissey and Thorobandy West within E70/2237 represent outcrops of metamorphosed banded \n",

      "4.1 Regional Geology of the Mt Aubrey Tenement \n",
      " \n",
      "Detailed geological mapping of the Mt Aubrey tenement had not been completed at the end of the \n",
      "Reporting Period, although prospective ironstone units appear to be localised 2km north of Mt Aubrey \n",
      "Well in the far north of the tenement. Ground truthing of identified magnetic targets within E09/1004 \n",

      " \n",
      "4.2 Structure and Metamorphism \n",
      " \n",
      "The BIF at Morrissey (E70/2237) is steeply dipping (60-90°) with variable strike and tight to isoclinal \n",
      "folds. Polyphase deformation was inferred by the overprinting of Z-folds by S-folds, demonstrating that \n",
      "the New Forest region went through a minimum of two deformational phases (Brown & Johnston, \n",
      "2005). Further evidence of intense disruption of the system can be observed in the forms of recumbent \n",
      "folding, and overturned cross bedding. Fold hinges and parallel mineral lineations display variable dip \n",
      "(between 30 and 80 degrees) and dip direction (from NE to S), which corresponds with the assertion \n",
      "that “no consistent orientation of fold axes (are) preserved in (the) metamorphic rocks” (Baxter, 1974). \n",
      "Cleavage planes are common around fold hinges where the bedding achieves maximum disruption due \n",
      "to intense compression, however in some areas; the fold hinge appears to have undergone extension and \n",
      "remains largely undisrupted, except for cm scale quartz veins which crosscut the bedding.  \n",
      " \n",
      "The identified BIF’s lack sharp, definitive contacts with the surrounding migmatite. Quartz veins \n",
      "commonly intrude the BIF parallel to bedding, except in extensional regions within fold hinges. Folded \n",
      "quartz veins are frequently observed throughout the BIF, which suggests high temperatures and quartz \n",
      "vein emplacement occurred before or during the deformation of the unit. This is consistent with the \n",
      "regional picture of the 1:250,000 sheet (Baxter et al, 1968), where granitic plutons intrude Archaean \n",

      "7. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS \n",
      " \n",
      "The bulk of the haematite mineralisation within Midwest’s Mt Aubrey tenement is inferred to occur as \n",
      "amphibolite-facies banded iron formation. However, the iron formations (known from E70/2237) are \n",
      "cherty and of relatively low Fe grade (30-45% Fe) and are unlikely to be economic in their own right.  \n",
      "Given the restricted extent of the iron resource at New Forest it is unlikely that there is the potential for \n",
      "a standalone DSO operation here.  There may be an underlying magnetite deposit beneath the oxidised \n",
      "banded iron haematite but there is not the surface expression to support the presence of a larger buried \n",
      "body of ironstone mineralisation.  \n",
      " \n",
      "Several conclusions can be drawn from the preceding geological investigations. \n",
      " \n",
      "1. Any further mineral exploration in the Mt Aubrey tenement is unlikely to find any large new \n",
      "surface expressions of iron mineralisation. \n",
      "2. No reliable estimations of depth extent of the mineralisation or of present resources can yet be \n",
      "made. \n",
      "4. There may be potential for a quartz-magnetite deposit at depth at New Forest. The potential \n",
      "economic viability of such a deposit is unknown but it should be borne in mind in any future work \n",
      "programmes. \n",
      "5. Known surface iron grades are low and it is not expected that there will be any improvement in the \n",
      "grade of the existing haematite at depth. \n",
      " \n",
      "Following on from this work several recommendations have been outlined below: \n",
      " \n",
      "1. Significant portions of the southern tenement at the eastern and south-western extremes of the \n",
      "tenement, beyond the localities of significant interest at Morrissey and Thorobandy West, \n",
      "should be and were surrendered. A similar exercise will be undertaken for E09/1004 upon \n",
      "receival of detailed geophysical interpretation. \n",
      "2. Further exploration for haematite mineralisation should be undertaken in the next reporting year \n",
      "on the reduced land holding to confirm the small size of the inferred haematitic BIF near Mt \n",
      "Aubrey in the far north of the tenement. \n",
      "3. Further investigations to be undertaken within the Mt Aubrey tenement should also determine \n",
      "the extent, if any, of an underlying quartz-magnetite resource, which may be more substantial \n",
      "than surface exposure suggests. To this end, Midwest should complete a search of public \n",
      "domain geophysical databases to see if there is the possibility of the existence of a buried \n",
      "magnetite orebody of any significance. \n",
