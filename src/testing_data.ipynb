      " \n",
      "No ground disturbing fieldwork was undertaken within the tenement during the reporting period since \n",
      "Midwest was only successful in obtaining a signed Heritage Agreement from the Yamatji Land and Sea \n",
      "Council part the way through the reporting period. Additionally, a series of cyclonic events in the \n",
      "northwest of Western Australia, left large areas adjacent to the Murchison River catchment (including \n",
      "the New Forest Project area) virtually impassable for the months between January and April 2006. \n",

      "The New Forest iron ore mineralisation occurs as highly weathered, outcropping bands of haematite and \n",
      "quartz-haematite mineralisation within Archaean banded iron formations on either side of the Murchison \n",
      "River.  The majority of BIF outcrops known from the New Forest Project are located around Morrissey \n",
      "Well and occur as a gentle rise (~20-30 metres), above the surrounding flood plain, 3km south of the \n",
      "Murchison River (in E70/2237).  Lesser amounts of BIF occur at Thorobandy West in the northern part \n",
      "of E70/2237.  The bulk of E09/1004 comprises deeply weathered granite terrain covered extensively by \n",
      "lateritic sands and soils; however, detailed mapping of this tenement has yet to occur. \n",
      " \n",
      "The mineralisation around New Forest appears to be limited to amphibolite grade metamorphism of \n",
      "Archaean banded iron formations, with some minor enrichment by subsequent surficial weathering events. \n",
      " \n",
      "Based upon the observable surface outcrop and historical government mapping (Baxter, 1974), there \n",

      "This report has been prepared as an investigation of the Mt Aubrey tenement, as part of Midwest’s New \n",

      "to be submitted to the Department of Industry and Resources as part of the conditions of the granting of \n",

      "The project area is accessed by road from Perth by following the Great Northern Highway to Wubin, \n",
      "(270km north of Perth), then from Wubin to Mullewa (488km north of Perth). From Mullewa, the \n",
      "Melia Creek tenement is reached following the Mullewa-Carnarvon Road north to the New Forest-\n",
      "Yallalong Road turnoff, 87km north of Mullewa, and following this road north for 40km. Alternatively, \n",
      "from the closest port at Geraldton, New Forest can be reached by travelling east along the Geraldton-\n",
      "Mount Magnet Road to Mullewa for 98km, and then once more following the Mullewa-Carnarvon \n",

      "The Mt Aubrey tenement (E09/1004) is located north of the Murchison River within the Murchison \n",
      "Shire of Western Australia on the Murgoo 1:250,000 topographic map sheet (SG50-14), and the \n",
      "Muggamurra (2042) and Billaballong (2043) 1:100,000 topographic map sheets. The tenement is \n",
      "situated on an alluvial flood plain of the Murchison River, approximately 250m above sea level with \n",
      "some areas outcropping some 10 to 20m above the surrounding plain. \n",
      " \n",
      "The Tenement overlies several Pastoral Leases including, from southwest to northeast, Pine Grove, \n",
      "Woolgarong, New Forest and Yallalong.  \n",
      " \n",
      "Access around the area is by station tracks and fence lines across the tenement. The dense vegetation \n",
      "within the tenement, as well as southwards around the Murchison River, hampers 4WD access \n",
      "throughout most of the tenement, restricting any detailed investigations to foot traverses. Periodic heavy \n",
      "rainfall and flooding can degrade the quality of the access tracks and further encumber access. While \n",
      "there are no signs of prior drill pads or exploration access tracks, small artificial mounds and trenches, \n",
      "now overgrown, have been observed throughout the tenement, and are most likely dry blowings left \n",
      "from previous gold exploration and prospecting. \n",
      " \n",
      "The area is semi-arid with a low annual rainfall (around 200mm), usually associated with frontal \n",
      "depressions from the south, although tropical depressions may penetrate this far south between October \n",
      "and March (Stockdale, 1994). Temperatures exceed 40oC in summer and average about 20oC in winter. \n",
      "Although dry for most of the year, high rainfall events can severely hamper access to the general area \n",
      "by degrading the quality of unsealed roads and making local access tracks impassable. The ideal field \n",
      "season is winter and spring, with August – September being the lowest rainfall period corresponding \n",
      "with mild temperatures.  \n",
      " \n",
      "Vegetation throughout the tenement consists of 1 to 2m tall, dense eucalypt and acacia scrub with \n",
      "wattle, merging into ghost gums up to 10m tall within several hundred metres of the Murchison River \n",
      "and other smaller tributaries. Grasses are uncommon within the New Forest Project area; however \n",
      "wildflowers proliferate during the period July to October. Although relatively flat, the dense vegetation \n",
      "restricts off-road 4WD traverses, consequently the use of foot traverses is the simplest way to examine \n",

      "resource in the Mt Aubrey tenement will ultimately depend very heavily upon the depth extent of the \n",
      "mineralisation, which cannot be determined without drilling programme(s).  However, it should be noted \n",
      "that the width of the outcropping haematitic BIF is unlikely to be extensive and the prospect for significant \n",
      "tonnages is therefore low.  Furthermore, the tenor of the surface mineralisation to the south is also low and \n",

      "7. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS \n",
      " \n",
      "The bulk of the haematite mineralisation within Midwest’s Mt Aubrey tenement is inferred to occur as \n",
      "amphibolite-facies banded iron formation. However, the iron formations (known from E70/2237) are \n",
      "cherty and of relatively low Fe grade (30-45% Fe) and are unlikely to be economic in their own right.  \n",
      "Given the restricted extent of the iron resource at New Forest it is unlikely that there is the potential for \n",
      "a standalone DSO operation here.  There may be an underlying magnetite deposit beneath the oxidised \n",
      "banded iron haematite but there is not the surface expression to support the presence of a larger buried \n",
      "body of ironstone mineralisation.  \n",
      " \n",
      "Several conclusions can be drawn from the preceding geological investigations. \n",
      " \n",
      "1. Any further mineral exploration in the Mt Aubrey tenement is unlikely to find any large new \n",
      "surface expressions of iron mineralisation. \n",
      "2. No reliable estimations of depth extent of the mineralisation or of present resources can yet be \n",
      "made. \n",
      "4. There may be potential for a quartz-magnetite deposit at depth at New Forest. The potential \n",
      "economic viability of such a deposit is unknown but it should be borne in mind in any future work \n",
      "programmes. \n",
      "5. Known surface iron grades are low and it is not expected that there will be any improvement in the \n",
      "grade of the existing haematite at depth. \n",
      " \n",
      "Following on from this work several recommendations have been outlined below: \n",
      " \n",
      "1. Significant portions of the southern tenement at the eastern and south-western extremes of the \n",
      "tenement, beyond the localities of significant interest at Morrissey and Thorobandy West, \n",
      "should be and were surrendered. A similar exercise will be undertaken for E09/1004 upon \n",
      "receival of detailed geophysical interpretation. \n",
      "2. Further exploration for haematite mineralisation should be undertaken in the next reporting year \n",
      "on the reduced land holding to confirm the small size of the inferred haematitic BIF near Mt \n",
      "Aubrey in the far north of the tenement. \n",
      "3. Further investigations to be undertaken within the Mt Aubrey tenement should also determine \n",
      "the extent, if any, of an underlying quartz-magnetite resource, which may be more substantial \n",
      "than surface exposure suggests. To this end, Midwest should complete a search of public \n",
      "domain geophysical databases to see if there is the possibility of the existence of a buried \n",
      "magnetite orebody of any significance. \n",
