He is the founder, chairman, CEO, and CTO of SpaceX; angel investor, CEO, product architect, and former chairman of Tesla, Inc.; owner, executive chairman, and CTO of X Corp.; founder of the Boring Company and xAI; co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI; and president of the Musk Foundation. He is one of the wealthiest people in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$190 billion as of March 2024. \\n\\nIn 1995, he moved to California to attend Stanford University but dropped out after two days and co-founded online city guide software company Zip2. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. In 2002, eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion, and that same year, Musk founded SpaceX with $100 million. In 2004, he became an early investor in Tesla Motors, Inc. In 2013, he proposed a hyperloop high-speed vactrain transportation system. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI. In 2022, he acquired Twitter for $44 billion. In March 2023, he founded xAI, an artificial intelligence company.\\n\\nMusk has expressed views that have made him a polarizing figure. He has been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, including COVID-19 misinformation and antisemitic conspiracy theories. In 2018, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued him, alleging that he had falsely announced that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. \\n\\nMusk was born in Pretoria, South Africa's administrative capital. He is of British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry. His mother, Maye Musk, is a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada. His father, Errol Musk, is a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, emerald dealer, and property developer. Elon has a younger brother, Kimbal, and a younger sister, Tosca. \\n\\nMusk attended various schools and universities, including Waterkloof House Preparatory School, Bryanston High School, Pretoria Boys High School, the University of Pretoria, Queen's University, and the University of Pennsylvania. He held internships in Silicon Valley and founded several successful companies. \\n\\nIn 2002, Musk founded SpaceX and became the company's CEO and Chief Engineer. SpaceX has achieved several milestones in space exploration, including launching the Falcon 1 rocket and developing the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets. In 2020, SpaceX launched its first crewed flight, becoming the first private company to place astronauts into orbit. \\n\\nIn 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology startup company. Neuralink aims to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence by creating devices that are embedded in the brain. The company also hopes to develop devices to treat neurological conditions. \\n\\nMusk has been involved in various controversies, including legal battles with the SEC and criticism for his statements and actions. Despite this, he remains a prominent figure in the technology and business world.\", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1713259487, model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_c2295e73ad', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=648, prompt_tokens=5287, total_tokens=5935))\n",
