# This file holds the path to the directory containing geological surveys.

# Instructions:
# Replace the value of the 'directory_path' variable with the actual path to your directory.
# For example, if your documents are located at "/path/to/geological_docs",
# set -> directory_path = "/path/to/geological_docs"

directory_path = r"..\..\wamex\data"  # Replace this with the location of your geological surveys

# Note:
# - Ensure the path is a string and properly formatted based on your operating system.
# - For Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS) ->    Use '/'.
# - For Windows ->                              Use '\\' or raw strings (r"path\to\geological_documents").
