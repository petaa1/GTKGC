      "An extensive review of all historical databases, publicly available and remotely sensed data generated exploration targets which were followed up with rock chip sampling and soil sampling programs. The geochemical anomalies identified have been prioritised resulting in the voluntary partial surrender of exploration tenements 08/1717, 08/1718 and 08/1725 of the Capricorn Project. Coodardoo Formation - The formation comprises a series of prominent sandstone dominated ridges that define the Wanna Syncline to the southwest of the Capricorn Project area. The formation ranges in thickness from 150 to 350 metres and is dominated by lithic quartz arenites and quartz arenites with angular to rounded quartz comprising 60-80% of the rock. It is the youngest stratigraphic unit in the Edmund Group. The lithologies present are thought to represent a turbidite fan deposit with a source most likely in the northwest. The formation stands out with distinct sub rounded boulders forming scree slopes and alluvial boulder plains making walking and vehicle access difficult. Ullawarra Formation - Fine grained, siliciclastic rocks with moulds after evaporates and dark layers of kerogen and/or iron sulphide are the representative lithologies of the formation. The thickness varies from 100m immediately north of the Talga Fault to 650m in the south. A characteristic of the formation is the large volume of dolerite sills intruded south of the Talga Fault. There are no sills in the Ullawarra Formation north of the Talga Fault, and similar sills are less abundant in other Formations here. Manganese is a significant weathering product. The formation is interpreted to have been derived from a deep marine shelf environment, with no shallow water facies represented. Suspension settling has formed planar mudstones interrupted by deposition of sandstone beds from dilute turbidity currents. Palaeocurrent data suggests uplift to, and sediment supply from the southeast representing a major change in palaeogeography compared to underlying units that were primarily derived from the northeast and northwest. Field observations indicate the top of the formation at least is structurally deformed possibly indicating low angle shear zones. Undeformed Backdoor Formation dolomites unconformably overlie the unit where deformation has been observed. Intra-formational conglomerate and breccias have been identified in an area centred on 510100mE and 7370500mN. These are strongly calcareous and have high assay levels of Ba and Mn. Siltstone clasts up to 0.5 metres are identified. Although the Kenneth Range 1:100,000 geology map suggests otherwise, this breccia unit is considered to be the top of the Ullawarra Formation lying beneath Backdoor Formation. Devil Creek Formation - This formation is a prominent carbonate unit, generally 85 to 200m thick which thickens southwest across the Talga Fault. Dolostone breccias immediately adjacent to the Talga Fault are considerably thicker (1-10m) and coarser grained with a chaotic internal structure. The distribution of lithofacies reflects platform carbonates north of the Talga Fault and basinal mudstones south of the fault. The fault itself is marked by slope facies breccias and may have been rimmed by a stromatolite reef with a palaeoslope to the southwest. Manganese occurs as a weathering product of dolostones and dolomitic siltstones mainly south of the Talga Fault. Discovery Formation (formerly Discovery Chert) - This formation is recognized throughout the region as a major marker horizon ranging from 50 to 250m thick. The dominant primary lithology is considered to be a silicified carbonaceous siltstone with psedomorphs after pyrite and evaporates rather than a primary chert. Basal contact may be a basin-wide disconformity caused by a major marine transgression that crossed the region from southwest to northeast. Deposition is considered to have occurred within a starved anoxic environment below storm wave base. Outcrops are locally stained with copper oxides in thin bedding-parallel seams and late stage fractures, and the Formation has been a major exploration target for base metals. It hosts stratabound Cu and Zn at Mount Palgrave and south of Illirie Bore. Copper is associated with thin beds rich in hematite and goethite after pyrite. Muntharra Formation - This is restricted mainly to the area southeast of Doolgarrie Creek (Ullawarra) and northwest of Thorpe Bore (Elliott Creek) where it is 30 to 50m thick and appears to be restricted to an area immediately adjacent to the Talga Fault. Lithologies are localised high-energy deposition of carbonate grainstone, dolomitic sandstone and sandstone. The absence of stromatolites suggest deposition occurs below the photic zone. Pseudomorphs after pyrite, disseminated iron oxides suggest deposition in an anoxic environment. The upper and lower contacts are sharp with all lithologies silicified to some degree. No mineralization is known but silicified quartz sandstones around Doolgarrie Creek are commonly cut by quartz veins and ferruginous breccias with quartz stringers. Kiangi Creek Formation - The Kiangi Formation typically ranges from 200 to 550m thick, with the thickest sections southwest of the Talga Fault. Lithologies consist mainly of varying proportions of interbedded siltstone, sandstone with minor conglomerate and dolostone. Siltstones contain pseudomorphs after pyrite, gypsum and dolomite. The thickness and proportion of sandstone (turbidites) increases significantly southwest of the Talga Fault, a trend not observed across the other major structures. The Kiangi Formation was mainly deposited below storm wave base with the bulk of the sandstones typical of turbidites. Carbonaceous siltstones are locally stained with copper oxides. Veinlets and disseminations of copper oxide along bedding planes in siltstones have been mined for agricultural purposes at the Blue Rocks prospect. Cheyne Spring Formation - The formation ranges from 50 to 300metres thick with the thickest section immediately adjacent to the Talga Fault but which thins rapidly to the south. The formation is characterized by a striped airphoto pattern due to the presence of interbedded dololutite, dolomitic siltstone and siltstone. The lithologies are interpreted as an association of shelf and pelagic dolostones that marks slight shallowing of the Edmund Basin. Field observation supports a broadly southwest sloping shelf. Blue Billy Formation - In Auroras tenements the mapped outcrop coincides with a prominent linear uranium-channel radiometric anomaly for over 150km of strike. Sedimentary thickness ranges from 0 to 500m, generally less than 200m, being thickest in the vicinity of Irregully Gorge and thinning to south and east. The lower contact is sharp and conformable. Lithologies are primarily of a distinctive parallel-planar laminated, black, pyritic, carbonaceous fissile to flaggy siltstone that weathers to a blue-grey color. There is local silicification and gypsum crystals suggest evaporites. The Blue Billy Formation is interpreted as a transgressive deposit of deep marine anoxic mudstone that records transgression and expansion of the Edmund Basin beyond the preserved limits of the Pingandy Shelf. The Blue Billy sandstones are interpreted as turbidite and mass flow deposits. The Blue Billy Formation has been a target for sediment-hosted base metal exploration especially around Irregully Gorge where it is anomalously thick and enriched in zinc. This area also corresponds with the most anomalous part of the radiometric anomaly and a change to an E-W strike. Gooragoora Formation - This formation is a 150 to 250m thick persistent unit best developed north of the Talga fault, pinching out to the southwest. The upper contact is with the Blue Billy Formation which is marked by an abrupt change to pyritic, carbonaceous siltstone. It may be unconformable at its lower contact. The Gooragoora Formation is interpreted to have been deposited by the pro-gradation of course grained deltaic sandstone during a period of high or rising sea level. Deltaic sedimentation is restricted to the north-western parts of the Edmund where uplift to the northwest exceeded the rate of sea level rise. Irregully Formation - The most common unit is a massive to laminated dololutite consisting of fine-grained dolomicrite locally recrystallised to patches and veins of dolospar. Formation thickness varies from 350m to over 2000m thick. The variation in thickness relates to syndepositional movement along the Talga Fault. The Irregully Formation is dominated by slope facies carbonates, which suggests localized steep paleoslopes possibly due to movement along the major bounding faults. The formation has been explored for base metals, and hosts localized Pb and Zn mineralization at the Dome Prospect on the Pingandy Shelf. Yilgatherra Formation - This formation comprises a basal sandstone and conglomerate which is overlain by siltstone and is between 30 to 350m thick. The depositional environments north of the Talga fault appear to be dominated by fluvial to intertidal mixed siliciclastic-carbonate settings, whereas fluvial to subtidal settings predominates south of the fault. Soil sampling was carried out over one prospect which resulted in the downgrading of the target and the subsequent surrender of tenement blocks. The results of assay analyses are included in the attached digital files. Figure 12: Capricorn Project: Aurora Minerals Rock Chip Sampling . Figure 13: Capricorn Project: Aurora Minerals Soil Sampling A number of historical geochemical surveys have been carried out over the Project area which form a comprehensive stream sediment dataset. Interpretation of this data has outlined several anomalies while downgrading other potential targets resulting in the surrender of a significant proportion of the Capricorn Project. GSWA Geochemistry The entire Project area was covered by GSWA stream sediment sampling. BHP Dataset During the 1980s BHP conducted a significant regional stream sediment geochemical program within the area of the Bangemall Basin. Aurora imported this data into MAPINFO for spatial analysis, but no significant assay results were evident. CRA Dataset As part of their original regional exploration program CRA conducted a small stream sediment and rock chip sampling program in the northern area of what is now the Capricorn Project. The CRA stream sediment data was weakly anomalous, with a maximum assay result reported of 105ppm Cu, 259ppm Zn and 23ppm Pb. The significance of these anomalies is yet to be determined. Figure 10 below displays the extent of these datasets relative to the remainder of the Project. Figure 10: Capricorn Project: GSWA and WAMEX Geochemistry Programs Figure 11: Capricorn Project: Historic drilling Dolerite sills were intruded into the Bangemall Supergroup shortly after sedimentation and prior to regional deformation during the Edmundian Orogeny and are dated at 1070Ma. Mineralisation (Cu, Pb, Zn, Ag) associated with sills is mostly in sill-parallel structures located in adjacent host rock. The Edmundian Orogeny, 1070 to 755Ma, is the last major tectonic event in the Capricorn area. It resulted in two main periods of deformation and low-grade metamorphism. The first involved mostly N-S shortening whereas the second reflected initial compression then extension along an ESE to WNW line followed by dextral strike-slip movement. Northeast of the Talga Fault, the Pingandy Shelf rocks are cut locally by small, steeply dipping, SE or ESE trending faults. Metamorphic grade is low. Southwest of the Talga Fault, the structure is dominated by the Wanna Syncline, an asymmetric SE plunging synclinorium that developed over a reactivated system of horst and graben blocks. The principal structural elements that controlled Edmund Group deposition are parallel to the trend of major structures in the underlying Ashburton Fold Belt and Gascoyne complex; these include the Talga Fault, the partially faulted southern limb of the Wanna Syncline, the Lyons River Fault and the NW trending fault system that bounds the Mangaroon Syncline. Preliminary gravity modelling by the GSWA suggests the presence of a 40km wide SE trending graben, with a broad axial horst block, beneath the Wanna Syncline. The northern margin of the graben coincides with the Talga Fault. Also, the likely presence of a narrow, north-trending graben beneath the north-western part of the Wanna Syncline (between MGA400000E 7353800N and 390300E 7401500N) is indicated. The Talga Fault is a major NW trending normal fault that has undergone significant reverse movement during the Edmundian Orogeny. It separates the north-eastern and central zones of the Edmund Fold Belt. The throw of the fault decreases from the NW where it juxtaposes Wyloo Group against Kiangi Creek Formation (middle Edmund Group) to the SE where it cuts the upper Edmund Group. In the latter area its surface trace is marked by an en echelon series of open to tight folds and short connecting fault segments. The Talga Fault is concealed beneath regolith for much of its length but crops out near Strama Bore on Irregully Creek (MGA 457800E 7398000N) where the fault plane dips 45o to the SW and there is evidence of significant reverse movement. The major fold structure, the Wanna Syncline, is an asymmetric SE plunging synclinorium whose gently dipping NE limb is cut by the Talga Fault. Its axial trace is kinked, and exhibits a marked change in trend from SSE to SE near Ferrier Bore (MGA 436000E 7396000N) interpreted as a cover response to dextral movement along a SSE trending basement splay of the Talga Fault. There are several major cross cutting northeast trending faults that have been locally infilled by dolerite dykes. These structures often terminate magnetic units and also VTEM conductors. This suggests that the faults may be part of the original basin forming normal faults that have since been reactivated or infilled by the dolerite intrusions. These faults may be important in defining third order basins. A number of exploration companies have carried out drilling in the Capricorn Project area including CRA (Item10554 - A54569) and Alcoa (Item 1469 A12226). The assay results of these programs predominantly record anomalous zinc. Figure 11 above depicts the location of the historic drill holes relative to the surrendered tenement blocks. As noted in the introduction, the Talga Fault has been recently mapped by the GSWA. This structure is considered to be the main basinal growth fault and dewatering structure for the entire Bangemall Basin and is hence of fundamental significance to the basin architecture and to the possible emplacement of mineral deposits within the rocks of the Capricorn Project. Aurora digitized the projected location of the Talga fault and used this as a fundamental piece of geological information in most other geological interpretations. Figure 6 below highlights the interpreted position of the Talga Fault relative to the geology of the Capricorn Project area. Figure 6: Capricorn Project: Talga Fault on the GSWA Geology Map Ilgarari Formation - This formation marks a change to an interpreted transgressive deep marine shelf deposit. Sediments comprise greenish-grey to black pyritic and carbonaceous siltstone that is locally silicified. This formation is intruded extensively by dolerite sills. Calyie formation - The Calyie Formation is a cliff-forming sandstone unit which has a gradational contact with the Backdoor Formation. The lower contact is defined by a thick bedded coarse to very coarse grained sandstone unit. The remainder of the formation comprises medium to coarse grained sandstone in which feldspar is generally absent. The Calyie Formation was mostly deposited in a shallow marine to fluvial depositional environment which shows a change from delta front to delta top depositional environment in the transition from the Backdoor Formation. Backdoor Formation - A distinctive unit of interbedded siltstone and dolostone marks the base of the Backdoor Formation which unconformably overlies Coodardoo Formation. This unit weathers and fractures into unique sculptured rock forms. Overlying is an olive green to maroon to grey fissile to flaggy siltstone which makes up the bulk of the Backdoor Formation. Thin sandstone beds comprise up to 10% of the formation. These lithologies suggest an environment below storm wave base on a distal siliciclastic shelf with a source area to the northeast. The coarser grained sandstones more prevalent in the upper part of the formation indicate deposition close to or above storm wave base. This shows a record of progradation from distal shelf to proximal shelf. Airborne Magnetics: Geoscience Australia has compiled the airborne magnetic data for Western Australia. Aurora engaged Dataviz and Baigent Geophysical to process this data for interpretation. Aerial photography: Aurora obtained some Digital Ortho-Rectified Aerial Photography from Landgate to assist with geological interpretation of the Capricorn Project area. LANDSAT: Aurora purchased a proprietary LANDSAT image from EarthScan Australia for the purpose of detecting iron hydroxides which can be associated with mineralization resulting from geochemical alteration. Figure 3 below displays this LANDSAT treatment in relation to the Capricorn Project and depicts high concentrations of iron hydroxides as green colours. The image highlights linear stratigraphic units rich in iron oxide which were prioritised for further investigation. Auroras Capricorn Project area covers the north-western part of the Edmund Basin where it lies unconformably on the Ashburton Basin. The Talga Fault strikes NW-SE through the remaining tenement area. The Ashburton Basin is represented by the Wyloo Group, a 12km thick SE trending sequence of low-grade meta-sediments and meta-volcanic rocks, the upper sequences of which are present in the project area. Here, the Ashburton Formation comprises mudstone and siltstone with lesser quartz-sandstones. Sands, silts and muds of the Capricorn Group were deposited unconformably on deformed and metamorphosed Wyloo Group. The Capricorn Orogeny resulted from the collision of the Archaean Yilgarn and Pilbara Cratons, probably between 1830 and 1620Ma in conjunction with metamorphism and widespread granitic intrusions of the Gascoyne Complex. The Ashburton Fold Belt formed in response to this and includes the Wyloo and Capricorn Group rocks. Three structural zones are recognized, but only the last two are present in the project area. F2 folds are large, 100-6000m wavelength, non-cylindrical and trend W to NW and develop a penetrative, axial plane, slaty to crenulated cleavage. Axial planes dip steeply SW or NE. Numerous WNW to NNW dextral wrench faults parallel F2 fold axes. Most of these D2 faults are marked by a line of en echelon quartz veins, and host the known Cu, Au, Pb, Ag mineralization. Low-grade metamorphism accompanied this deformation. The Edmund and Collier Basins are the youngest tectonic units within the Capricorn Orogen. They unconformably overlie, and form a broad regional syncline between the Ashburton Basin in the northeast and the Gascoyne Complex in the southwest. The Edmund Basin was initiated during intercratonic extensional reactivation of structures formed during earlier stages of the Capricorn Orogen. Within the Capricorn Project area the Edmund Basin can be separated into a relatively stable shelf (Pingandy Shelf), separated by the Talga Fault from a deeper basin, horst-and-graben terrane floored by Gascoyne Complex rocks to the southwest. The main rock types within the Edmund Basin are fine-grained siliciclastic and carbonate sedimentary rocks with lesser coarse-grained clastic rocks. Evaporites and pyrobitumens are known, and probably were originally much more extensive than currently reported. Table 3: Geological Sequence of Collier and Edmund Groups: Ilgarari Formation Collier Group Calyie Formation Backdoor Formation Coodardoo Ullawarra Devil Creek Discovery Muntharra Edmund Group Kiangi Creek Cheyne Springs Blue Billy Gooragoora Irregully Yilgatherra The Talga Fault (or its precursor) appears to have acted as a major basin-margin or growth fault, controlling sedimentary deposition and basin development with platformal sediments to the northeast and deeper water, thicker sediments in the subsiding basin to the southwest. For example the depositional thickness of the Irregully Formation varies from 350m (NE) to over 2000m (SW) across the fault, related to syndepositional movement along the Talga Fault. The following descriptions are based on the explanatory notes from the GSWA 1:100,000 map sheets Maroonah, Ullawarra, Capricorn, Mangaroon, Edmund and Elliot Creek. Exploration by Aurora Minerals Limited (Aurora) on the Capricorn Project (the Project) has focused on sedex style base metal deposits, associated with the 200 kilometre long eastsoutheast trending Talga Fault zone identified by the Geological Survey of Western Australia (GSWA). Field work comprised reconnaissance mapping and prospecting, rock chip sampling, soil sampling and completion of an airborne magnetic and VTEM survey. Many EM conductors were identified and were followed up by rock chip sampling, soil sampling and ground inspection. Some significant assay results, generally from ferruginous veins or fault zones, have been returned. No visible evidence of strong base metal mineralization or significant alteration zones have been identified to date; however identifying alteration in the weathered sediments is problematic. The collected data has been analysed along with the historic WAMEX data and the publicly available geophysical and remote sensing images to focus exploration prospecting. This work has downgraded the prospectivity of large sections of C64/2010 and the tenements have subsequently been surrendered. The remaining tenements of the Project have also been partially surrendered and it is these partial surrenders that are the subject of this report. Once all of the remotely sensed images were processed and the position of the Talga fault was accurately established, interpretation of the images was undertaken. The following figure depicts interpretation of LANDSAT data. Figure 7: Interpretation of LANDSAT Figure 8: Capricorn Project: Geophysical Interpretation over GSWA 1:250 000 Geology The image above depicts the position of the Talga fault along with magnetic highs (blue) and magnetic linears (red), LANDSAT interpretation (pink) and U Radiometric interpretation (yellow). The analysis of the interpretation of remotely sensed images has resulted in the downgrading of those portions of the Project which have since been surrendered. Future exploration work will focus on those features located on the portion of the Capricorn Project that has been retained. Figure 9 below highlights features of interest interpreted from LANDSAT imagery that invited further prospecting and rock chip sampling. These have been prioritised resulting in the partial surrender of the remaining Project tenements. Figure 9: Capricorn Project: Landsat Targets-742 Landsat Image Table 2 below summarises the results of the WAMEX data compilation for the partially surrendered tenements of the Capricorn Project.

The area was also included in the GSWA regional stream sediment sampling program and has been demonstrated to be geochemically anomalous in the economic metals Au, Zn, Pb, Cu and U. Most historical exploration has been conducted to the north of the Project, away from the Talga Fault. Immediately to the north of the Aurora tenements 1ies the historic Bali group of workings which produced an estimated 600t of around 10% copper, from shallow open pit workings. Mining was also carried out in the 1950s and 60s on Casleys Lease. The Ashburton Goldfields are amongst the oldest in the state, with the Top Camp region, near E08/1691, being one of the earliest discoveries. Top Camp has a reported production of approximately 10,000oz of alluvial and primary gold from 1889 until 1966. It is thought that official production figures are conservative and that 21,000oz is a better estimate. A single gold nugget weighing 76 oz was found at Top Camp in 1893. Soldiers Secret, which was discovered at the same time as Top Camp has been the site of many anecdotal alluvial gold finds. However there are no official production figures. In addition to these known resource areas fine grained alluvial gold and gold nuggets have been found by prospectors using metal detectors, dry blowing and panning from a number of creeks peripheral to and from within, the Capricorn project area. To the north of the Project the younger Pingandy Shelf and unconformity were explored by a succession of companies including Pasminco and CRA. They focused on the shallowly dipping Pingandy Shelf sediments, exploring for Mississippi Valleystyle, flat lying Pb-Zn deposits, similar to those at Cadgebut, which resides in similar, shallow dipping Leonard Shelf sediments on the northern margin of the Canning Basin. They dont appear to have recognised the potential for Mt Isa style deposits associated with steeply dipping deeptapping structures such as the Talga Fault, that provide conduits for metal bearing fluids. Five companies or JVs have contributed to the bulk of the geological knowledge associated with the Capricorn project; Rio Tinto/CRA, Alcoa/Anaconda JV, Pasminco, MIM and Newcrest/Pasminco JV. Each of these groups mounted sustained and generally detailed programs over various parts of the Capricorn Project over a number of years. The compilation of geological knowledge relevant to the Capricorn Project has also been augmented by some detailed work by prospectors and smaller exploration companies. Historical exploration on the granted tenements includes limited RC and diamond drilling, stream sediment sampling and minor rock chip sampling. The Gascoyne and Ashburton Regions are underlain by rocks of the Capricorn Orogen, a major tectonic zone between the Archaean Yilgarn and Pilbara Cratons. The Ashburton Basin rocks along the north-eastern half of the project area belong to the Palaeoproterozoic 2446-1786Ma Wyloo Group comprising low-grade metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks. The unconformably overlying Blair Basin is represented by the ca. 1806Ma metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks of the Capricorn Group. The Gascoyne Complex is composed of Palaeoproterozoic metasedimentary and metaigneous rocks which are extensively intruded by large volumes of granite. At least three zones of deformation and medium to high-grade metamorphism are recognized, with two periods of granite intrusion at 1830-1780Ma (Capricorn Orogeny) and 1680-1620Ma (Mangaroon Orogeny). The Capricorn Orogeny also deformed and metamorphosed rocks of the Ashburton and Blair Basins, giving them their characteristic NW-SE fold axis, shear and foliation trends and lowgrade metamorphic mineral suite. At some stage the Ashburton Basin and the Gascoyne Complex joined along a NW-SE trending suture, now represented by the Talga Fault, and formed the basement for Edmund Basin sedimentation. The Late Palaeoproterozoic to Mesoproterozoic Edmund and Collier Basins together form the Bangemall Supergroup, previously referred to as the Bangemall Basin. The Edmund Group is at least 4km thick and consists of mostly fine grained siliciclastic and carbonate sedimentary rocks. It is younger than 1620Ma and older than the ca. 1465Ma suite of dolerite sills which intrude it. The 2.0 to 2.5 km- thick Collier Basin disconformably overlies the Edmund Basin and consists largely of siliciclastic sedimentary rocks. Most of the Collier Basin developed to the East, outside the Capricorn Project area at about 1400 to 1070Ma. An extensive system of dolerite sills intrudes both the Edmund and Collier Group rocks and is dated at 1078 to 1070Ma. The 1070-755Ma Edmundian Orogeny is an intracratonic event that deformed the Bangemall Supergroup, reactivating basement structures as reverse faults. Rocks of the Capricorn Orogeny are cut by NE trending dolerite dykes of the 755Ma Mundine Well dyke swarm, NNW dolerite dykes of similar age, and quartz veins of various orientations. In addition, ferruginous veins and linear alteration zones (mostly SE-ESE) cut the Gascoyne Complex and Bangemall Supergroup. Figure 2 below, shows the regional geology in the vicinity of the surrendered tenements. Figure 2: Capricorn Project: Partially Surrendered Tenements and Regional Geology Geoscience Australia has compiled the radiometrics for all of WA. Aurora Minerals obtained the WA Uranium Channel Radiometrics and had the data reprocessed by Dataviz and Mark Baigent Geophysical Services. The radiometric image displayed two distinct forms of radiometric anomalism. The first is layer or bedding parallel anomalism, which can be seen as linear features parallel to the geological bedding. It is known from the GSWA and WAMEX reports that some of the units within the Bangemall Basin are naturally higher in uranium than the surrounding beds; however these are not economic sources of uranium. A number of cross-cutting radiometric features were identified in the uranium channel interpretation and these need to be investigated by further prospecting and rock chip sampling. Figure 5 below depicts Uranium Channel radiometric data over the Capricorn Project Area. Figure 5: Capricorn Project: Uranium Channel Radiometrics The Capricorn Project comprised 19 exploration licences all acquired in the name of Aurora Resources Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Aurora Minerals Limited (Aurora). 16 licenses were surrendered on 3 October 2011 and 3 were partially surrendered, the latter being the subject of this report. Table 1 below, lists the tenements that have been partially surrendered from the Project. The tenements are located on GlenFlorrie, Kooline and Ullawarra Pastoral Stations. Access to the tenements from the west is through Glenflorrie via the North Coastal Highway. Internal access around the tenements is very limited. Access from the north and east is via the unsealed Paraburdoo-Meekatharra shire road, which leaves the sealed Paraburdoo-Nanutarra highway 85km west of Paraburdoo. The distance from the bitumen to the project area is in the order of 150 km. Figure 1 below, illustrates the location of the partially surrendered tenements with respect to the topography. Figure 1: Capricorn Project Location and Access As no ground disturbance occurred within the surrendered tenements there was no requirement for rehabilitation. Auroras regional dataset includes geological plans, airborne radiometrics, airborne magnetics and Landsat imagery. All of the various datasets were assessed with the aim of identifying and prioritising exploration targets, the result of which has been the surrender of a large portion of the Capricorn Project area. The remaining tenements of the Capricorn Project focus on the north western portion of the Talga Fault. The Capricorn Project is located 950 km north of Perth, Western Australia and 100 km southwest of Paraburdoo. It comprised 19 exploration licences, of which 16 have been surrendered. The Project is centred on the Talga Fault zone and interpreted splays and extensions. The Project tenements have combined reporting status C64/2010. Although there is no recorded mine production in the Project area, exploration in the early 1970s to 1990s identified anomalous Zn, Ag, As and Ba geochemistry at several prospects in settings similar to the sedimentary exhalative (SEDEX) style Mt Isa mine in western Queensland. The recognition of the Talga Fault and the possibility of mantle-tapping mineralising fluids led Aurora Minerals to take up exploration of the area. Project topography varies from flat sheet-wash covered areas adjacent to large creek systems that flow into the Ashburton River to steep hill country largely inaccessible to 4WD. Ranges sub parallel to the trend of the Talga Fault form prominent ridges that inhibit north-south vehicle access except where creeks have eroded through the ranges. This arid region is only sparsely vegetated except along creeks and around water holes where large gums grow. Temperatures are mild during the winter with sparse rainfall. During the summer temperatures reach above 45 degrees Celsius and the area becomes unworkable for regional exploration. The area is prone to cyclonic events that develop in the Timor Sea at irregular intervals. Aurora conducted extensive rock chip sampling across the surrendered tenement blocks as illustrated in Figure 12. The sample locations and the results of geochemical analyses conducted by Ultratrace Analytical Laboratories, Perth, WA are tabulated in the attached data file.

      "Test Sentence: An extensive review of all historical databases, publicly available and remotely sensed data generated exploration targets which were followed up with rock chip sampling and soil sampling programs. The geochemical anomalies identified have been prioritised resulting in the voluntary partial surrender of exploration tenements 08/1717, 08/1718 and 08/1725 of the Capricorn Project. Coodardoo Formation - The formation comprises a series of prominent sandstone dominated ridges that define the Wanna Syncline to the southwest of the Capricorn Project area. The formation ranges in thickness from 150 to 350 metres and is dominated by lithic quartz arenites and quartz arenites with angular to rounded quartz comprising 60-80% of the rock. It is the youngest stratigraphic unit in the Edmund Group. The lithologies present are thought to represent a turbidite fan deposit with a source most likely in the northwest. The formation stands out with distinct sub rounded boulders forming scree slopes and alluvial boulder plains making walking and vehicle access difficult. Ullawarra Formation - Fine grained, siliciclastic rocks with moulds after evaporates and dark layers of kerogen and/or iron sulphide are the representative lithologies of the formation. The thickness varies from 100m immediately north of the Talga Fault to 650m in the south. A characteristic of the formation is the large volume of dolerite sills intruded south of the Talga Fault. There are no sills in the Ullawarra Formation north of the Talga Fault, and similar sills are less abundant in other Formations here. Manganese is a significant weathering product. The formation is interpreted to have been derived from a deep marine shelf environment, with no shallow water facies represented. Suspension settling has formed planar mudstones interrupted by deposition of sandstone beds from dilute turbidity currents. Palaeocurrent data suggests uplift to, and sediment supply from the southeast representing a major change in palaeogeography compared to underlying units that were primarily derived from the northeast and northwest. Field observations indicate the top of the formation at least is structurally deformed possibly indicating low angle shear zones. Undeformed Backdoor Formation dolomites unconformably overlie the unit where deformation has been observed. Intra-formational conglomerate and breccias have been identified in an area centred on 510100mE and 7370500mN. These are strongly calcareous and have high assay levels of Ba and Mn. Siltstone clasts up to 0.5 metres are identified. Although the Kenneth Range 1:100,000 geology map suggests otherwise, this breccia unit is considered to be the top of the Ullawarra Formation lying beneath Backdoor Formation. Devil Creek Formation - This formation is a prominent carbonate unit, generally 85 to 200m thick which thickens southwest across the Talga Fault. Dolostone breccias immediately adjacent to the Talga Fault are considerably thicker (1-10m) and coarser grained with a chaotic internal structure. The distribution of lithofacies reflects platform carbonates north of the Talga Fault and basinal mudstones south of the fault. The fault itself is marked by slope facies breccias and may have been rimmed by a stromatolite reef with a palaeoslope to the southwest. Manganese occurs as a weathering product of dolostones and dolomitic siltstones mainly south of the Talga Fault. Discovery Formation (formerly Discovery Chert) - This formation is recognized throughout the region as a major marker horizon ranging from 50 to 250m thick. The dominant primary lithology is considered to be a silicified carbonaceous siltstone with psedomorphs after pyrite and evaporates rather than a primary chert. Basal contact may be a basin-wide disconformity caused by a major marine transgression that crossed the region from southwest to northeast. Deposition is considered to have occurred within a starved anoxic environment below storm wave base. Outcrops are locally stained with copper oxides in thin bedding-parallel seams and late stage fractures, and the Formation has been a major exploration target for base metals. It hosts stratabound Cu and Zn at Mount Palgrave and south of Illirie Bore. Copper is associated with thin beds rich in hematite and goethite after pyrite. Muntharra Formation - This is restricted mainly to the area southeast of Doolgarrie Creek (Ullawarra) and northwest of Thorpe Bore (Elliott Creek) where it is 30 to 50m thick and appears to be restricted to an area immediately adjacent to the Talga Fault. Lithologies are localised high-energy deposition of carbonate grainstone, dolomitic sandstone and sandstone. The absence of stromatolites suggest deposition occurs below the photic zone. Pseudomorphs after pyrite, disseminated iron oxides suggest deposition in an anoxic environment. The upper and lower contacts are sharp with all lithologies silicified to some degree. No mineralization is known but silicified quartz sandstones around Doolgarrie Creek are commonly cut by quartz veins and ferruginous breccias with quartz stringers. Kiangi Creek Formation - The Kiangi Formation typically ranges from 200 to 550m thick, with the thickest sections southwest of the Talga Fault. Lithologies consist mainly of varying proportions of interbedded siltstone, sandstone with minor conglomerate and dolostone. Siltstones contain pseudomorphs after pyrite, gypsum and dolomite. The thickness and proportion of sandstone (turbidites) increases significantly southwest of the Talga Fault, a trend not observed across the other major structures. The Kiangi Formation was mainly deposited below storm wave base with the bulk of the sandstones typical of turbidites. Carbonaceous siltstones are locally stained with copper oxides. Veinlets and disseminations of copper oxide along bedding planes in siltstones have been mined for agricultural purposes at the Blue Rocks prospect. Cheyne Spring Formation - The formation ranges from 50 to 300metres thick with the thickest section immediately adjacent to the Talga Fault but which thins rapidly to the south. The formation is characterized by a striped airphoto pattern due to the presence of interbedded dololutite, dolomitic siltstone and siltstone. The lithologies are interpreted as an association of shelf and pelagic dolostones that marks slight shallowing of the Edmund Basin. Field observation supports a broadly southwest sloping shelf. Blue Billy Formation - In Auroras tenements the mapped outcrop coincides with a prominent linear uranium-channel radiometric anomaly for over 150km of strike. Sedimentary thickness ranges from 0 to 500m, generally less than 200m, being thickest in the vicinity of Irregully Gorge and thinning to south and east. The lower contact is sharp and conformable. Lithologies are primarily of a distinctive parallel-planar laminated, black, pyritic, carbonaceous fissile to flaggy siltstone that weathers to a blue-grey color. There is local silicification and gypsum crystals suggest evaporites. The Blue Billy Formation is interpreted as a transgressive deposit of deep marine anoxic mudstone that records transgression and expansion of the Edmund Basin beyond the preserved limits of the Pingandy Shelf. The Blue Billy sandstones are interpreted as turbidite and mass flow deposits. The Blue Billy Formation has been a target for sediment-hosted base metal exploration especially around Irregully Gorge where it is anomalously thick and enriched in zinc. This area also corresponds with the most anomalous part of the radiometric anomaly and a change to an E-W strike. Gooragoora Formation - This formation is a 150 to 250m thick persistent unit best developed north of the Talga fault, pinching out to the southwest. The upper contact is with the Blue Billy Formation which is marked by an abrupt change to pyritic, carbonaceous siltstone. It may be unconformable at its lower contact. The Gooragoora Formation is interpreted to have been deposited by the pro-gradation of course grained deltaic sandstone during a period of high or rising sea level. Deltaic sedimentation is restricted to the north-western parts of the Edmund where uplift to the northwest exceeded the rate of sea level rise. Irregully Formation - The most common unit is a massive to laminated dololutite consisting of fine-grained dolomicrite locally recrystallised to patches and veins of dolospar. Formation thickness varies from 350m to over 2000m thick. The variation in thickness relates to syndepositional movement along the Talga Fault. The Irregully Formation is dominated by slope facies carbonates, which suggests localized steep paleoslopes possibly due to movement along the major bounding faults. The formation has been explored for base metals, and hosts localized Pb and Zn mineralization at the Dome Prospect on the Pingandy Shelf. Yilgatherra Formation - This formation comprises a basal sandstone and conglomerate which is overlain by siltstone and is between 30 to 350m thick. The depositional environments north of the Talga fault appear to be dominated by fluvial to intertidal mixed siliciclastic-carbonate settings, whereas fluvial to subtidal settings predominates south of the fault. Soil sampling was carried out over one prospect which resulted in the downgrading of the target and the subsequent surrender of tenement blocks. The results of assay analyses are included in the attached digital files. Figure 12: Capricorn Project: Aurora Minerals Rock Chip Sampling . Figure 13: Capricorn Project: Aurora Minerals Soil Sampling A number of historical geochemical surveys have been carried out over the Project area which form a comprehensive stream sediment dataset. Interpretation of this data has outlined several anomalies while downgrading other potential targets resulting in the surrender of a significant proportion of the Capricorn Project. GSWA Geochemistry The entire Project area was covered by GSWA stream sediment sampling. BHP Dataset During the 1980s BHP conducted a significant regional stream sediment geochemical program within the area of the Bangemall Basin. Aurora imported this data into MAPINFO for spatial analysis, but no significant assay results were evident. CRA Dataset As part of their original regional exploration program CRA conducted a small stream sediment and rock chip sampling program in the northern area of what is now the Capricorn Project. The CRA stream sediment data was weakly anomalous, with a maximum assay result reported of 105ppm Cu, 259ppm Zn and 23ppm Pb. The significance of these anomalies is yet to be determined. Figure 10 below displays the extent of these datasets relative to the remainder of the Project. Figure 10: Capricorn Project: GSWA and WAMEX Geochemistry Programs Figure 11: Capricorn Project: Historic drilling Dolerite sills were intruded into the Bangemall Supergroup shortly after sedimentation and prior to regional deformation during the Edmundian Orogeny and are dated at 1070Ma. Mineralisation (Cu, Pb, Zn, Ag) associated with sills is mostly in sill-parallel structures located in adjacent host rock. The Edmundian Orogeny, 1070 to 755Ma, is the last major tectonic event in the Capricorn area. It resulted in two main periods of deformation and low-grade metamorphism. The first involved mostly N-S shortening whereas the second reflected initial compression then extension along an ESE to WNW line followed by dextral strike-slip movement. Northeast of the Talga Fault, the Pingandy Shelf rocks are cut locally by small, steeply dipping, SE or ESE trending faults. Metamorphic grade is low. Southwest of the Talga Fault, the structure is dominated by the Wanna Syncline, an asymmetric SE plunging synclinorium that developed over a reactivated system of horst and graben blocks. The principal structural elements that controlled Edmund Group deposition are parallel to the trend of major structures in the underlying Ashburton Fold Belt and Gascoyne complex; these include the Talga Fault, the partially faulted southern limb of the Wanna Syncline, the Lyons River Fault and the NW trending fault system that bounds the Mangaroon Syncline. Preliminary gravity modelling by the GSWA suggests the presence of a 40km wide SE trending graben, with a broad axial horst block, beneath the Wanna Syncline. The northern margin of the graben coincides with the Talga Fault. Also, the likely presence of a narrow, north-trending graben beneath the north-western part of the Wanna Syncline (between MGA400000E 7353800N and 390300E 7401500N) is indicated. The Talga Fault is a major NW trending normal fault that has undergone significant reverse movement during the Edmundian Orogeny. It separates the north-eastern and central zones of the Edmund Fold Belt. The throw of the fault decreases from the NW where it juxtaposes Wyloo Group against Kiangi Creek Formation (middle Edmund Group) to the SE where it cuts the upper Edmund Group. In the latter area its surface trace is marked by an en echelon series of open to tight folds and short connecting fault segments. The Talga Fault is concealed beneath regolith for much of its length but crops out near Strama Bore on Irregully Creek (MGA 457800E 7398000N) where the fault plane dips 45o to the SW and there is evidence of significant reverse movement. The major fold structure, the Wanna Syncline, is an asymmetric SE plunging synclinorium whose gently dipping NE limb is cut by the Talga Fault. Its axial trace is kinked, and exhibits a marked change in trend from SSE to SE near Ferrier Bore (MGA 436000E 7396000N) interpreted as a cover response to dextral movement along a SSE trending basement splay of the Talga Fault. There are several major cross cutting northeast trending faults that have been locally infilled by dolerite dykes. These structures often terminate magnetic units and also VTEM conductors. This suggests that the faults may be part of the original basin forming normal faults that have since been reactivated or infilled by the dolerite intrusions. These faults may be important in defining third order basins. A number of exploration companies have carried out drilling in the Capricorn Project area including CRA (Item10554 - A54569) and Alcoa (Item 1469 A12226). The assay results of these programs predominantly record anomalous zinc. Figure 11 above depicts the location of the historic drill holes relative to the surrendered tenement blocks. As noted in the introduction, the Talga Fault has been recently mapped by the GSWA. This structure is considered to be the main basinal growth fault and dewatering structure for the entire Bangemall Basin and is hence of fundamental significance to the basin architecture and to the possible emplacement of mineral deposits within the rocks of the Capricorn Project. Aurora digitized the projected location of the Talga fault and used this as a fundamental piece of geological information in most other geological interpretations. Figure 6 below highlights the interpreted position of the Talga Fault relative to the geology of the Capricorn Project area. Figure 6: Capricorn Project: Talga Fault on the GSWA Geology Map Ilgarari Formation - This formation marks a change to an interpreted transgressive deep marine shelf deposit. Sediments comprise greenish-grey to black pyritic and carbonaceous siltstone that is locally silicified. This formation is intruded extensively by dolerite sills. Calyie formation - The Calyie Formation is a cliff-forming sandstone unit which has a gradational contact with the Backdoor Formation. The lower contact is defined by a thick bedded coarse to very coarse grained sandstone unit. The remainder of the formation comprises medium to coarse grained sandstone in which feldspar is generally absent. The Calyie Formation was mostly deposited in a shallow marine to fluvial depositional environment which shows a change from delta front to delta top depositional environment in the transition from the Backdoor Formation. Backdoor Formation - A distinctive unit of interbedded siltstone and dolostone marks the base of the Backdoor Formation which unconformably overlies Coodardoo Formation. This unit weathers and fractures into unique sculptured rock forms. Overlying is an olive green to maroon to grey fissile to flaggy siltstone which makes up the bulk of the Backdoor Formation. Thin sandstone beds comprise up to 10% of the formation. These lithologies suggest an environment below storm wave base on a distal siliciclastic shelf with a source area to the northeast. The coarser grained sandstones more prevalent in the upper part of the formation indicate deposition close to or above storm wave base. This shows a record of progradation from distal shelf to proximal shelf. Airborne Magnetics: Geoscience Australia has compiled the airborne magnetic data for Western Australia. Aurora engaged Dataviz and Baigent Geophysical to process this data for interpretation. Aerial photography: Aurora obtained some Digital Ortho-Rectified Aerial Photography from Landgate to assist with geological interpretation of the Capricorn Project area. LANDSAT: Aurora purchased a proprietary LANDSAT image from EarthScan Australia for the purpose of detecting iron hydroxides which can be associated with mineralization resulting from geochemical alteration. Figure 3 below displays this LANDSAT treatment in relation to the Capricorn Project and depicts high concentrations of iron hydroxides as green colours. The image highlights linear stratigraphic units rich in iron oxide which were prioritised for further investigation. Auroras Capricorn Project area covers the north-western part of the Edmund Basin where it lies unconformably on the Ashburton Basin. The Talga Fault strikes NW-SE through the remaining tenement area. The Ashburton Basin is represented by the Wyloo Group, a 12km thick SE trending sequence of low-grade meta-sediments and meta-volcanic rocks, the upper sequences of which are present in the project area. Here, the Ashburton Formation comprises mudstone and siltstone with lesser quartz-sandstones. Sands, silts and muds of the Capricorn Group were deposited unconformably on deformed and metamorphosed Wyloo Group. The Capricorn Orogeny resulted from the collision of the Archaean Yilgarn and Pilbara Cratons, probably between 1830 and 1620Ma in conjunction with metamorphism and widespread granitic intrusions of the Gascoyne Complex. The Ashburton Fold Belt formed in response to this and includes the Wyloo and Capricorn Group rocks. Three structural zones are recognized, but only the last two are present in the project area. F2 folds are large, 100-6000m wavelength, non-cylindrical and trend W to NW and develop a penetrative, axial plane, slaty to crenulated cleavage. Axial planes dip steeply SW or NE. Numerous WNW to NNW dextral wrench faults parallel F2 fold axes. Most of these D2 faults are marked by a line of en echelon quartz veins, and host the known Cu, Au, Pb, Ag mineralization. Low-grade metamorphism accompanied this deformation. The Edmund and Collier Basins are the youngest tectonic units within the Capricorn Orogen. They unconformably overlie, and form a broad regional syncline between the Ashburton Basin in the northeast and the Gascoyne Complex in the southwest. The Edmund Basin was initiated during intercratonic extensional reactivation of structures formed during earlier stages of the Capricorn Orogen. Within the Capricorn Project area the Edmund Basin can be separated into a relatively stable shelf (Pingandy Shelf), separated by the Talga Fault from a deeper basin, horst-and-graben terrane floored by Gascoyne Complex rocks to the southwest. The main rock types within the Edmund Basin are fine-grained siliciclastic and carbonate sedimentary rocks with lesser coarse-grained clastic rocks. Evaporites and pyrobitumens are known, and probably were originally much more extensive than currently reported. Table 3: Geological Sequence of Collier and Edmund Groups: Ilgarari Formation Collier Group Calyie Formation Backdoor Formation Coodardoo Ullawarra Devil Creek Discovery Muntharra Edmund Group Kiangi Creek Cheyne Springs Blue Billy Gooragoora Irregully Yilgatherra The Talga Fault (or its precursor) appears to have acted as a major basin-margin or growth fault, controlling sedimentary deposition and basin development with platformal sediments to the northeast and deeper water, thicker sediments in the subsiding basin to the southwest. For example the depositional thickness of the Irregully Formation varies from 350m (NE) to over 2000m (SW) across the fault, related to syndepositional movement along the Talga Fault. The following descriptions are based on the explanatory notes from the GSWA 1:100,000 map sheets Maroonah, Ullawarra, Capricorn, Mangaroon, Edmund and Elliot Creek. Exploration by Aurora Minerals Limited (Aurora) on the Capricorn Project (the Project) has focused on sedex style base metal deposits, associated with the 200 kilometre long eastsoutheast trending Talga Fault zone identified by the Geological Survey of Western Australia (GSWA). Field work comprised reconnaissance mapping and prospecting, rock chip sampling, soil sampling and completion of an airborne magnetic and VTEM survey. Many EM conductors were identified and were followed up by rock chip sampling, soil sampling and ground inspection. Some significant assay results, generally from ferruginous veins or fault zones, have been returned. No visible evidence of strong base metal mineralization or significant alteration zones have been identified to date; however identifying alteration in the weathered sediments is problematic. The collected data has been analysed along with the historic WAMEX data and the publicly available geophysical and remote sensing images to focus exploration prospecting. This work has downgraded the prospectivity of large sections of C64/2010 and the tenements have subsequently been surrendered. The remaining tenements of the Project have also been partially surrendered and it is these partial surrenders that are the subject of this report. Once all of the remotely sensed images were processed and the position of the Talga fault was accurately established, interpretation of the images was undertaken. The following figure depicts interpretation of LANDSAT data. Figure 7: Interpretation of LANDSAT Figure 8: Capricorn Project: Geophysical Interpretation over GSWA 1:250 000 Geology The image above depicts the position of the Talga fault along with magnetic highs (blue) and magnetic linears (red), LANDSAT interpretation (pink) and U Radiometric interpretation (yellow). The analysis of the interpretation of remotely sensed images has resulted in the downgrading of those portions of the Project which have since been surrendered. Future exploration work will focus on those features located on the portion of the Capricorn Project that has been retained. Figure 9 below highlights features of interest interpreted from LANDSAT imagery that invited further prospecting and rock chip sampling. These have been prioritised resulting in the partial surrender of the remaining Project tenements. Figure 9: Capricorn Project: Landsat Targets-742 Landsat Image Table 2 below summarises the results of the WAMEX data compilation for the partially surrendered tenements of the Capricorn Project. Table 2:- Summary of the key WAMEX items covering the Capricorn Project Historic Project Name Aurora Tenements Historic Tenement Holder WAMEX Number William Range 5-6: E08/1717-1718 Rio Tinto Item 10554 Wannery Creek E08/1725 Irregully Creek Area E07/1717 Alcoa/Anaconda Capricorn Joint Venture E08/1725-1726 Wanna Station E08/1717 Alcoa-Anaconda Item 37 E08/1725 Geologically the region has been mapped in detail at 1:50,000 scale by GSWA as part of a Western Australian Government funded initiative. The area was also included in the GSWA regional stream sediment sampling program and has been demonstrated to be geochemically anomalous in the economic metals Au, Zn, Pb, Cu and U. Most historical exploration has been conducted to the north of the Project, away from the Talga Fault. Immediately to the north of the Aurora tenements 1ies the historic Bali group of workings which produced an estimated 600t of around 10% copper, from shallow open pit workings. Mining was also carried out in the 1950s and 60s on Casleys Lease. The Ashburton Goldfields are amongst the oldest in the state, with the Top Camp region, near E08/1691, being one of the earliest discoveries. Top Camp has a reported production of approximately 10,000oz of alluvial and primary gold from 1889 until 1966. It is thought that official production figures are conservative and that 21,000oz is a better estimate. A single gold nugget weighing 76 oz was found at Top Camp in 1893. Soldiers Secret, which was discovered at the same time as Top Camp has been the site of many anecdotal alluvial gold finds. However there are no official production figures. In addition to these known resource areas fine grained alluvial gold and gold nuggets have been found by prospectors using metal detectors, dry blowing and panning from a number of creeks peripheral to and from within, the Capricorn project area. To the north of the Project the younger Pingandy Shelf and unconformity were explored by a succession of companies including Pasminco and CRA. They focused on the shallowly dipping Pingandy Shelf sediments, exploring for Mississippi Valleystyle, flat lying Pb-Zn deposits, similar to those at Cadgebut, which resides in similar, shallow dipping Leonard Shelf sediments on the northern margin of the Canning Basin. They dont appear to have recognised the potential for Mt Isa style deposits associated with steeply dipping deeptapping structures such as the Talga Fault, that provide conduits for metal bearing fluids. Five companies or JVs have contributed to the bulk of the geological knowledge associated with the Capricorn project; Rio Tinto/CRA, Alcoa/Anaconda JV, Pasminco, MIM and Newcrest/Pasminco JV. Each of these groups mounted sustained and generally detailed programs over various parts of the Capricorn Project over a number of years. The compilation of geological knowledge relevant to the Capricorn Project has also been augmented by some detailed work by prospectors and smaller exploration companies. Historical exploration on the granted tenements includes limited RC and diamond drilling, stream sediment sampling and minor rock chip sampling. The Gascoyne and Ashburton Regions are underlain by rocks of the Capricorn Orogen, a major tectonic zone between the Archaean Yilgarn and Pilbara Cratons. The Ashburton Basin rocks along the north-eastern half of the project area belong to the Palaeoproterozoic 2446-1786Ma Wyloo Group comprising low-grade metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks. The unconformably overlying Blair Basin is represented by the ca. 1806Ma metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks of the Capricorn Group. The Gascoyne Complex is composed of Palaeoproterozoic metasedimentary and metaigneous rocks which are extensively intruded by large volumes of granite. At least three zones of deformation and medium to high-grade metamorphism are recognized, with two periods of granite intrusion at 1830-1780Ma (Capricorn Orogeny) and 1680-1620Ma (Mangaroon Orogeny). The Capricorn Orogeny also deformed and metamorphosed rocks of the Ashburton and Blair Basins, giving them their characteristic NW-SE fold axis, shear and foliation trends and lowgrade metamorphic mineral suite. At some stage the Ashburton Basin and the Gascoyne Complex joined along a NW-SE trending suture, now represented by the Talga Fault, and formed the basement for Edmund Basin sedimentation. The Late Palaeoproterozoic to Mesoproterozoic Edmund and Collier Basins together form the Bangemall Supergroup, previously referred to as the Bangemall Basin. The Edmund Group is at least 4km thick and consists of mostly fine grained siliciclastic and carbonate sedimentary rocks. It is younger than 1620Ma and older than the ca. 1465Ma suite of dolerite sills which intrude it. The 2.0 to 2.5 km- thick Collier Basin disconformably overlies the Edmund Basin and consists largely of siliciclastic sedimentary rocks. Most of the Collier Basin developed to the East, outside the Capricorn Project area at about 1400 to 1070Ma. An extensive system of dolerite sills intrudes both the Edmund and Collier Group rocks and is dated at 1078 to 1070Ma. The 1070-755Ma Edmundian Orogeny is an intracratonic event that deformed the Bangemall Supergroup, reactivating basement structures as reverse faults. Rocks of the Capricorn Orogeny are cut by NE trending dolerite dykes of the 755Ma Mundine Well dyke swarm, NNW dolerite dykes of similar age, and quartz veins of various orientations. In addition, ferruginous veins and linear alteration zones (mostly SE-ESE) cut the Gascoyne Complex and Bangemall Supergroup. Figure 2 below, shows the regional geology in the vicinity of the surrendered tenements. Figure 2: Capricorn Project: Partially Surrendered Tenements and Regional Geology Geoscience Australia has compiled the radiometrics for all of WA. Aurora Minerals obtained the WA Uranium Channel Radiometrics and had the data reprocessed by Dataviz and Mark Baigent Geophysical Services. The radiometric image displayed two distinct forms of radiometric anomalism. The first is layer or bedding parallel anomalism, which can be seen as linear features parallel to the geological bedding. It is known from the GSWA and WAMEX reports that some of the units within the Bangemall Basin are naturally higher in uranium than the surrounding beds; however these are not economic sources of uranium. A number of cross-cutting radiometric features were identified in the uranium channel interpretation and these need to be investigated by further prospecting and rock chip sampling. Figure 5 below depicts Uranium Channel radiometric data over the Capricorn Project Area. Figure 5: Capricorn Project: Uranium Channel Radiometrics The Capricorn Project comprised 19 exploration licences all acquired in the name of Aurora Resources Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Aurora Minerals Limited (Aurora). 16 licenses were surrendered on 3 October 2011 and 3 were partially surrendered, the latter being the subject of this report. Table 1 below, lists the tenements that have been partially surrendered from the Project. The tenements are located on GlenFlorrie, Kooline and Ullawarra Pastoral Stations. Access to the tenements from the west is through Glenflorrie via the North Coastal Highway. Internal access around the tenements is very limited. Access from the north and east is via the unsealed Paraburdoo-Meekatharra shire road, which leaves the sealed Paraburdoo-Nanutarra highway 85km west of Paraburdoo. The distance from the bitumen to the project area is in the order of 150 km. Figure 1 below, illustrates the location of the partially surrendered tenements with respect to the topography. Figure 1: Capricorn Project Location and Access As no ground disturbance occurred within the surrendered tenements there was no requirement for rehabilitation. Auroras regional dataset includes geological plans, airborne radiometrics, airborne magnetics and Landsat imagery. All of the various datasets were assessed with the aim of identifying and prioritising exploration targets, the result of which has been the surrender of a large portion of the Capricorn Project area. The remaining tenements of the Capricorn Project focus on the north western portion of the Talga Fault. The Capricorn Project is located 950 km north of Perth, Western Australia and 100 km southwest of Paraburdoo. It comprised 19 exploration licences, of which 16 have been surrendered. The Project is centred on the Talga Fault zone and interpreted splays and extensions. The Project tenements have combined reporting status C64/2010. Although there is no recorded mine production in the Project area, exploration in the early 1970s to 1990s identified anomalous Zn, Ag, As and Ba geochemistry at several prospects in settings similar to the sedimentary exhalative (SEDEX) style Mt Isa mine in western Queensland. The recognition of the Talga Fault and the possibility of mantle-tapping mineralising fluids led Aurora Minerals to take up exploration of the area. Project topography varies from flat sheet-wash covered areas adjacent to large creek systems that flow into the Ashburton River to steep hill country largely inaccessible to 4WD. Ranges sub parallel to the trend of the Talga Fault form prominent ridges that inhibit north-south vehicle access except where creeks have eroded through the ranges. This arid region is only sparsely vegetated except along creeks and around water holes where large gums grow. Temperatures are mild during the winter with sparse rainfall. During the summer temperatures reach above 45 degrees Celsius and the area becomes unworkable for regional exploration. The area is prone to cyclonic events that develop in the Timor Sea at irregular intervals. Aurora conducted extensive rock chip sampling across the surrendered tenement blocks as illustrated in Figure 12. The sample locations and the results of geochemical analyses conducted by Ultratrace Analytical Laboratories, Perth, WA are tabulated in the attached data file.

These results remain confidential as they remain relevant to the retained portion of the Project.
