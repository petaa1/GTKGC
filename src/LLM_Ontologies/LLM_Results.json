sealed MorawaYalgoo road passing through the southern area and the all weather gravel Dalgaranga road to the north.": {}, "Numerous station and exploration tracks can also be used for access within the tenements.": {}, "Enterprise Metals Limited - 3 Yalgoo Project Annual Report 2011 4 GEOLOGY 4.1 REGIONAL GEOLOGY The Yalgoo Project is situated within the western region of the Archaean Yilgarn Province and covers part of the northern portion of the Yalgoo-Gullewa Greenstone Belt of Western Australia, see Figure 2.": {}, "The Yalgoo-Gullewa Greenstone Belt is one of the most westerly belts of greenstone within the larger Murchison Province.": {}, "The structure of the area is typical of granite-greenstone terranes with linear, arcuate and synformal greenstone lying between large domal masses of granite and gneiss.": {}, "Muhling & Low (1977) stated that the area consists of low to medium grade metamorphic rocks forming arcuate belts which have been intruded by oval-shaped composite batholiths.": {}, "Mapping and geochronology by the Geological Society of Australia (Arriens, 1971) reveal that the granitic rocks in the western part of the Yalgoo 1:250,000 map sheet are in the order of 2,800 to 3,000 ma.": {}, "Detailed mapping carried out within the southern Gullewa Greenstone Belt (Muhling & Low, 1977) revealed a N-S trend for the belt averaging approximately 1km in thickness.": {}, "Despite the overall N-S trend, the belt is broken into several hills which are separated along strike by plains of recent sediments.": {}, "Granitic rocks surround the greenstone belt and are also exposed as low hills.": {}, "Banded iron formation (BIF) units occur within the greenstone belt as sedimentary horizons within a dominant volcanic pile.": {}, "The volcanics are almost exclusively metabasalts in the north, while coarser grained variants (and other tuffs) dominate the south.": {}, "Early deformation events (D1/D2) resulted in E-W trending folds which were subsequently refolded during a major D3 event, responsible for the overall N-S trend of the greenstone belt.": {}, "The D3 folds are open to isoclinal folds and are in places overturned.": {}, "These events have been followed by longitudinal faulting and associated quartz veining.": {}, "There is a general trend of thickening of the BIF units towards the north, and also around D3 fold hinges.": {}, "A major N-S lineament, the Salt Creek Fault, passes through the eastern part of the Gullewa Greenstone Belt.": {}, "Secondary northeast trending shears splay off the western side of the Salt Creek Fault and may control gold mineralisation in the belt.": {}, "In the main lobe of the belt the strata are folded into a major east-west trending syncline, with clastic sediments at the core (Gullewa Gold NL, 1998).": {}, "Typical of the geology of the Yilgarn Craton, the rocks in the area have undergone prolonged lateritic weathering during the Tertiary, followed by dessication and deposition of Quaternary sediments in colluvial, alluvial, lacustrine and aeolian settings.": {}, "This has resulted in the variable landforms and geomorphology of the region (Muhling & Low, 1977).": {}, "4.2 LOCAL GEOLOGY The project area is located approximately 300-350m above sea level within the Salinaland physiographic division of Jutson (1950), which is characterised by wide valleys, comprised of colluvial material between areas of high ground of outcrop and Cainozoic sandplain.": {}, "Drainage is generally to the south-southeast into the Salt River, which empties into the Burra Salt Lake to the south.": {}, "The Geological Survey of Western Australia (GSWA) has mapped mafic rock units in the north and south of the Project area (Muhling & Low, 1977).": {}, "These mafic rocks are dominated by volcanics (basalt and high-mg basalt) with subordinate mafic to ultramafic intrusive rocks (gabbro, dolerite & diorite), some felsic rocks and BIF.": {}, "Refer to Figure 3 for an illustration of the GSWA mapping of the Yalgoo 1:250,000 map sheet.": {}, "The basalt is pale green to grey and shows primary structures and textures such as pillow lavas, breccias, variolites and ovoid blebs containing amphiboles with skeletal textures.": {}, "The basalt comprises tremolite-actinolite and plagioclase with minor quartz and sphene.": {}, "According to Muhling & Low (1977) the dolerite and gabbro units located in the northern project area occur in sills which show minor differentiation.": {}, "Thin ultramafic bands occur towards the base, and more felsic minerals occur towards the top.": {}, "The greenstone package has a WSW-ENE trend in the south and a N-S to NE-SW trend in the central/north, and is flanked by large domal masses of granite and gneiss.": {}, "A large proportion of the project area is blanketed by Quaternary alluvial and colluvial sediments, as well as remnant laterite caps in some locations.": {}, "4.3 YALGOO STRUCTURAL INTERPRETATION Major regional structural elements of the Yalgoo Belt are dominated by fault-bounded south-plunging folds and west-dipping to sub-vertical faults.": {}, "The north and eastern part of the belt comprises the Noongal Anticline, a well-exposed structure plunging 60-80 degrees to the south; it has an overturned (west-dipping) eastern limb and prominent west-dipping axial plane cleavage.": {}, "To the east of this structure are fault-repeated slices of south plunging syncline defined by cyclic repetitions of thin layered sills (Wadgingarra Gabbro).": {}, "(Comet Resources Ltd, 2003) A review of the regional deformation within the Yalgoo Greenstone Belt by AngloGold geologists (Anglogold Australia Ltd., 2001) recognised four deformational events both at the outcrop scale and on regional aeromagnetic images of the greenstone belt.": {}, "The current architecture of the belt reflects the dominant D3 deformation event.": {}, "The structural evolution is summarised below.": {}, "D1 is characterised by early thrusting, resulting in small-scale to regional recumbent folds and duplication of stratigraphy.": {}, "Small-scale thrusts are best observed in the BIF and finergrained sedimentary units.": {}, "Thick competent units do not record this folding, reflecting the heterogeneous strain in the sequence.": {}, "S1 develops parallel to So with the axial surfaces of F1 folds parallel to S1.": {}, "The orientation of F1 axial surfaces is variable and a function of where they are located with respect to F2 and F3 folds.": {}, "D2 is interpreted as coaxial to D1 and reflects the progressive nature of the D1-D2 deformation event.": {}, "Early D1 recumbent folds are refolded about an inclined axial surface.": {}, "The orientations of the D2 fold axes parallel the strike of stratigraphy/enveloping surfaces and represent intra-formational folds.": {}, "These are recognised on regional D3 folds as folds where the fold axis strikes parallel to the bedding.": {}, "In addition the symmetry of these folds Enterprise Metals Limited - 5 Yalgoo Project Annual Report 2011 may be inconsistent with that of second order F3 folds and is indicative of an earlier folding event.": {}, "D3 is characterised by folding about a north-south axis, with fold symmetry indicating a westerly vergence.": {}, "In the regional south-plunging anticline, D1-D2 structures are best preserved in the hinge.": {}, "The geometry of these structures is best illustrated by constructing a longitudinal section parallel to the axial surface of the F3 fold.": {}, "On the limbs of these folds earlier structures are hard to recognise as the higher strain rotates older structures into parallelism.": {}, "The change in stratigraphic thickness is mostly the result of elongation parallel to the stretching lineation and that of D1 structures may not develop on the limb as they are in the hinge of this structure.": {}, "The Mougooderra shear zone is a westdipping thrust that truncates the western limb of the regional D3 syncline.": {}, "On the eastern limb of the syncline a D1 thrust duplex and ramp anticline are exposed.": {}, "Excellent exposures of transposed fabrics S1 folded and truncated by S3 are exposed in this area.": {}, "D4 is characterised by northwest-trending faults/shears, minor folds and quartz veins.": {}, "The structures postdate the emplacement of a late-post D3 granitoid and porphyry suite and appear to be restricted to the western side of the Mougooderra shear zone and traverse the regional D3 anticline.": {}, "The D4 structures have both ductile and brittle features that would suggest generation during unroofing of the terrain.": {}, "Further to the south, the Mougooderra shear zone west of the footwall syncline contains numerous small gold workings associated with northwest-trending brittle structures that crosscut the mylonitic fabric.": {}, "At the one locality where these were measured they dip at 35 towards 050.": {}, "The orientations of other small stopes appear similar (Anglogold Australia Ltd, 2001).": {}, "4.4 MINERALISATION 4.4.1 Gold A search through the Department of Mines and Petroleum (DMP) Minedex database reveals several historic gold prospects/workings located with E59/1437.": {}, "A goldcopper prospect with historic workings at Whelock, gold workings at Edargo Treasure, and two gold prospects (from historic drilling) named Telegraph 1 & 2.": {}, "The mineralisation at Whelock and Edargo Treasure is associated with mafic volcanic rocks along with mafic/ultramafic intrusive units.": {}, "Within the Yalgoo 1:250,000 map sheet (but outside the Project area), Muhling & Low (1977) have described gold occurring in all rock types of the Archaean succession and also in adamellite, although most of the major mines are in metabasalt.": {}, "A few are associated with metagabbro and one, the Mugga King, is in sheared granite porphyry.": {}, "A few mines, such as the Emerald mine, at Yalgoo are in ultramafic rocks.": {}, "The only major deposits in BIF are the Victoria United and Monarch mines, both situated southwest of Gullewa.": {}, "The mining centres of Gullewa, Noongal, Yalgoo and Carlaminda are on or near, the axes of anticlines.": {}, "The Gnows Nest and Bilberatha centres occur on the crests of northeasterly plunging anticlines.": {}, "All these mining centres are located in areas which were probably subject to tensional forces during folding.": {}, "From the 1960s to 1985 exploration focused upon the base metal and gold potential of the Gullewa belt.": {}, "4.4.2 Uranium The only record of uranium exploration within the Project area was a programme of soil sampling and minor drilling by Magna Mining NL between 2007-2009.": {}, "The Magna Mining geological model used for their Badja Project is a calcrete hosted palaeochannel, where uranium is precipitated under neutral oxidising conditions associated with vanadium to form carnotite.": {}, "It is believed vanadium derived in clays from weathered mafics beneath calcrete provides the neutral conditions necessary for the uranium mineral carnotite to precipitate (Webster, 2007).": {}, "4.4.3 Uranium Exploration Rationale The northern Yilgarn catchments cover an extensive area of Archaean granitic rocks which contain between 2 and 25ppm uranium.": {}, "Oxidising conditions have prevailed in places to depths of up to several hundred metres and under these conditions uranium is mobilised as uranyl ion complexes and transported laterally in groundwater.": {}, "Where groundwaters reach drainage valleys, the water table rises to 1-5m below surface.": {}, "Evaporation and loss of carbon dioxide promotes precipitation, particularly of calcium and magnesium carbonates.": {}, "This process can precipitate the uranium bearing mineral carnotite in fissures or between carbonate and clay particles.": {}, "Butt et al., (1984) further distinguished types of calcrete-hosted uranium based on the location of the mineralisation.": {}, "Calcrete-hosted uranium is found either in the main drainage channel itself or in the calcrete delta or platform in which case it is called a valley deposit (e.g.": {}, "Yeelirrie, Lake Way), or in the alluvial playa sediments (e.g.": {}, "Lake Maitland), or in terraces (e.g.": {}, "Minindi Creek).": {}, "The Yeelirrie uranium deposit, discovered by Western Mining Corporation (now BHP Billiton) in 1972 contains 52,500t of U3O8 at a grade of 1.5 kg/t U308 using a 0.5 kg/t cutoff grade and is considered a model for most explorers.": {}, "Calcrete hosted uranium mineralisation is comprised of the soluble hydrated potassium-uranium vanadate mineral carnotite, K2(UO2)2(VO4)2.3H2 The carnotite post-dates the calcrete, commonly occurring as void linings in porcellanous varieties, as seams and disseminations in earthy varieties, as fracture paint on slip planes around the margin of mounds, and as grain coatings within the clay-sand host beneath the calcrete.": {}, "The vanadium within the carnotite is thought to be derived from nearby mafic rocks.": {}, "5 PREVIOUS EXPLORATION Previous exploration work within the Project area and surrounds has mainly focussed on gold and base metals, however minor work targeting iron, titanium/vanadium, platinum and rare earths has also been undertaken.": {}, "There is only one WAMEX record of previous exploration relating to uranium (within E59/1645) carried out by Magna Mining NL between 2007-2009.": {}, "Enterprise Metals Limited - 7 Yalgoo Project Annual Report 2011 Magna completed ground based spectrometer surveys (33 lines for 1,480 readings) and MMI soil sampling (209 samples) over four uranium targets identified from regional airborne radiometric data.": {}, "An 18 hole vertical aircore programme (584m) was subsequently completed, following up elevated spectrometer values and a maximum soil value of 23.6ppm U.": {}, "No anomalous results were returned from the drilling.": {}, "Extensive lag and rockchip sampling targeting gold and base metals was undertaken in the northern part of the Project (E59/1437, E59/1655) by Gullewa Gold and Paladin Resources.": {}, "Gold and copper values were generally subdued and no further work completed, see Figure 4.": {}, "From an initial open file data search, historic drilling is concentrated within the central part of the Project (E59/1437) targeting gold and base metals.": {}, "A total of 334 historic drillholes comprising 275 RAB holes and 59 aircore holes have been drilled, for a total of 11,544m with the majority of this drilling carried out by Dalrymple Resources NL, Sons of Gwalia Ltd and Gullewa Gold NL.": {}, "Hole depths ranged from 1m to 106m, with an average hole depth of 32m.": {}, "Many of these elevated values have been returned from the Telegraph prospect and appear to be associated with mafic volcanic rocks in a structurally complex area.": {}, "Refer to Figure 5 for a plan of historic drillhole locations plotted over the 1VD aeromagnetic image.": {}, "Considering the relatively sparse drill coverage overall and no deep RC or core drilling, potential may exist for follow up drilling to further evaluate these anomalous results, and also the Whelock and Edargo Treasure prospects.": {}, "6 WORK CARRIED OUT FOR THE PERIOD ENDING 24

secured to cover the Ullawarra Formation and its detrital hinterland where outcrops of massive manganese oxide were found within at least three consecutive shale-siltstone units.": {}, "Prior to 2010, most of the activity by Aurora Minerals Ltd on its Capricorn Project focused on the northern limit of the Bangemall Basin, around the Talga Fault where the basin abuts the Ashburton Basin.": {}, "However, with the discovery of a significant strike length of outcropping massive manganese in the Ullawarra Formation near Dooley Downs, attention shifted to this and the Capricorn SE Project was established.": {}, "A team of geologists was contracted to carry out detailed mapping around the best outcrops of massive manganese and so delineate drilling targets.": {}, "No significant manganese was identified on the surrendered tenement sub-blocks.": {}, "As the Project is part of the Bangemall Basin, the tenements were considered to be potentially prospective for base metals.": {}, "However no prospective structures or hosts to base metals were located in the surrendered sub-blocks by field reconnaissance or analysis of historical and remotely sensed data.": {}, "No ground exploration work other than reconnaissance geological field checking was undertaken on the surrendered sub-blocks during the period to 3 October 2011.": {}, "LOCATION AND ACCESS The Capricorn Southeast Project is located approximately 900 kilometres north of Perth in Western Australia.": {}, "The Project stretches approximately 122kms in a broadly east-west direction centred on Isle Bore, 50km east of Mt Augustus and straddling the Mt Augustus-Paraburdoo Road.": {}, "Being a well-known tourist destination, Mt Augustus has a reasonable, unsealed airstrip accessible by small commercial aircraft.": {}, "It is reached by road either from the west through Cobra Station or from the south, through Meekatharra, via the Great Northern Highway, or through Geraldton or Carnarvon via the West Coastal Highway.": {}, "Roads to Mt Augustus from Meekatharra (350kms), Gascoyne Junction (270kms) and Mullewa (580kms) are unsealed and closed after heavy rainfall when large rivers become impassable.": {},

The Geological Survey of WA (GSWA) has published a number of geological and mineral occurrence maps that include the Project area and none have any record of economic mineral occurrences within the partially surrendered blocks.": {}, "The Deep Frederick Well Pb/Zn prospect (MGA50 489500E /7337000N) lies just to the west of the Project within Auroras exploration tenement E09/1836.": {}, "Manganese is reported much further east but this is well outside of the Project area and occurs much lower in the sequence within the Kiangi Creek Formation.": {}, "The most significant exploration within the Project area was probably the diamond search by De Beers, which had a camp on the Lyons River for 5 years.": {}, "BHP and RioTinto have also carried out regional exploration in the area, following up stream sediment sampling.": {}, "A small number of drill holes were evident near Peedawarra Creek just southwest of Dooley Downs outstation but there was clearly no follow-up.": {}, "The GSWA produced a series of regolith geochemistry plans which included the Project area.": {}, "It was a manganese anomaly in this data that first attracted Aurora to the area and lead to the subsequent discovery of the manganese ridges.": {}, "REGIONAL GEOLOGY The primary manganese mineralization that constitutes the exploration target is associated with several shale/siltstone units of the Ullawarra Formation of the Middle Proterozoic Edmund Group of marine sediments.": {}, "After the Mangaroon Orogeny had deformed and metamorphosed the Gascoyne Complex around 1620Ma, the Bangemall Basin comprising the Edmund and Collier sub-basins, developed between the Pilbara and Yilgarn Cratons.": {}, "The Edmund Group is at least 4km thick and consists of mostly fine grained siliciclastic and carbonate sedimentary rocks.": {}, "It is younger than 1620Ma and older than the ca.": {}, "1465Ma suite of dolerite sills that intrude it.": {}, "The 2.0 to 2.5 kilometre thick Collier Basin disconformably overlies the Edmund Basin and consists largely of siliciclastic sedimentary rocks.": {}, "Most of the Collier Basin developed to the north and east, outside the Project area at about 1400 to 1070Ma.": {}, "A second system of dolerite sills intrudes both the Edmund and Collier Group rocks and is dated at 1078 to 1070Ma.": {}, "The 1070-755Ma Edmundian Orogeny was an intracratonic event that deformed the Bangemall Supergroup, reactivating basement structures as reverse faults.": {}, "Around 570Ma the Mulka Orogeny further deformed the rocks and saw intrusion of dolerite dykes, quartz and ferruginous veining and linear alteration zones.": {}, "The dominant regional structure of the Bangemall Group is an arcuate, SE to Etrending synclinorium that is a direct continuation of the Edmundian folds.": {}, "The major synclinal zones in the south of the Mount Egerton sheet area trend NE to eastward and form a subordinate structural axis of the Bangemall Basin.": {}, "These synclinal zones are separated by a WNW-trending zone of basement arches in the Mount Phillips sheet area.": {}, "Folds within the Bangemall Group are mostly concentric in style, and dips vary from horizontal to vertical with a few overturned fold limbs.": {}, "Slaty cleavage is developed only in tight folds, and metamorphism is extremely low grade.": {}, "A plan of the Project area overlaying regional outcrop geology appears below (Figure 4) and shows intrusive dolerite sills in green as they relate to Edmund Group sediments in dark brown, Collier Group in light brown between the Ashburton Group to the northeast and Gascoyne Complex to the southwest.": {}, "Capricorn SE Project - Regional Geology Page | 11 6.": {}, "LOCAL GEOLOGY According to the Geological Survey of WA Explanatory notes for the Mt Egerton 1:250,000 Scale Sheet, 1978, the Ullawarra Formation is in part the lateral equivalent of the Devil Creek Formation which is a dolomitic silty shale and the transition from Devil Creek into Ullawarra is indeed manifest by the departure of dolomite.": {}, "The Ullawarra Formation is notable within the Edmund Group by the abundance of dolerite sills, and in the Project area, the siltstone units are each divided by dolerite.": {}, "Thus far outcropping massive Mn and subsequent exploration has been restricted to Ullawarra Formation north of the Lyons River North Branch which, while tightly folded and faulted, overall dips northward below the younger Collier Basin sediments.": {}, "Locally, the host siltstones form semi-continuous ridges striking WNW and dipping shallowly north, and are sporadically capped by surficial manganese concentration mapped by Aurora over a strike length of at least 90kms.": {}, "There are regular 500- 1500m-amplitude tight folds along this strike and the occasional low-displacement fault, but generally the horizons are relatively undeformed.": {}, "Rare small parasitic folds of 1-10m amplitude mimic the form of the larger folds, while there are occasional strike-parallel and NE trending cross-cutting veins of quartz-manganese breccias.": {}, "Massive to bedded manganese oxide caps the outcrops of siltstone, but in detail appears to be richer over some layers.": {}, "Aurora has recognized three main manganiferous siltstone horizons separated by dolerite sills, although there is evidence that suggests a fourth horizon.": {}, "Almost invariably the best concentration of manganese in outcrop occurs close to the top of the third siltstone horizon, 1-3m below the overlying dolerite.": {}, "There is often an intervening chert/fine quartzite unit between the manganese and the dolerite.": {}, "Some of the siltstone crops out as a flat area of interbedded shale and manganese, with the proportion of high Mn beds varying from 5-50%.": {}, "This suggests that the individual unweathered siltstone layers have variable Mn content.": {}, "Whilst petrological work is required on this siltstone protore ; visual evidence from RC drill chips indicate a background Mn content for the siltstone layers of 0-5%.": {}, "It is the objective of Aurora to find where this has been enriched to economic grades by diagenetic, supergene or hydrothermal processes.": {}, "There are a few isolated remnants of what may have been widespread laterite peneplain or gentle slope, preserved near the manganese ridge.": {}, "The laterite seems to consist of massive and pisolitic ironstone and ferruginous silica, with variable manganese content.": {}, "There are rare outcrops of massive manganese oxide within the laterite but these are rare compared to ironstone and silica.": {}, "Aurora considered the laterite to be a possible deposit type, although tonnage potential was clearly limited.": {}, "Another potential source of manganese mineralization is the detrital material shedding from eroding laterite and the massive manganese oxide on the ridge tops associated with the Ullawarra Formation siltstone.": {}, "By the time the siltstone sheds from the ridge tops the Mn content is generally greater than 20%.": {}, "Having a high density this would preferentially accumulate in gravity traps such as the beds and banks of paleochannels and the inside of meanders.": {}, "It is still not certain how far from the source this enriched manganese oxide is likely to travel and be enriched.": {}, "CURRENT EXPLORATION 7.1 Exploration Targets Upon reviewing GSWA stream geochemistry for the Edmund Basin, high levels of manganese were noted in some streams south towards the Lyons River.": {}, "Reconnaissance investigation came across outcrops of massive manganese capping a ridge of siltstone/shale near the road west of Dooley Downs outstation.": {}, "Further mapping soon outlined a large strike extent of manganiferous sediments within dolerite sills, and the Capricorn SE Project began.": {}, "The Project is therefore targeting primary and secondary manganese mineralization originating from Proterozoic Ullawarra formation siltstones.": {}, "Additionally, anomalous copper is associated with several of the dolerite units.": {}, "7.2 Geological Reconnaissance Publicly available airborne geophysics data and detailed airphoto imagery was acquired to support the systematic exploration of the Ullawarra Formation.": {}, "Several prospecting-style geological and geographic familiarization trips were carried out before systematic mapping and sampling on a regional scale was instigated.": {}, "Part way into the mapping program a helicopter was used to carry out a follow-up visit of many of the best prospects where thick, high grade mineralization was mapped in the first pass.": {}, "From this helicopter follow-up a number of prospects were selected for detailed structural mapping in order to best target RC drilling.": {}, "7.3 Geological Mapping and Rock-chip Geochemistry Jigsaw Geoscience was contracted to oversee systematic mapping and rock chip sampling of the manganiferous siltstone units of the Ullawarra Formation.": {}, "Thirteen rock chip samples were collected within the surrendered portion of E52/2139, the results of which are detailed in Table 2 below.": {}, "Reconnaissance geological groundtruthing was carried over the remaining surrendered tenement sub-blocks but no systematic mapping or further sampling was justified.": {}, "The next task was to prioritize these for follow-up drilling.": {}, "Again Jigsaw Geoscience was contracted to undertake the prospect-scale mapping and make recommendations for drilling.": {}, "This work narrowed down the initial priority targets to 44 prospects.": {}, "Based on these results reverse circulation drilling programs were planned and instigated, none of which encroached on the surrendered tenement subblocks.": {}, "7.5 Reconnaissance Detrital and Rock Chip Sampling In addition to the systematic mapping and sampling of the Ullawarra Formation, a reconnaissance-style mapping and sampling program was carried out peripheral to the ridges.": {}, "A number of creeks that drain the Ullawarra Formation siltstone beds contain rounded gravel and cobbles of moderate to high grade manganese oxide, within the high-energy bed load.": {}, "In places the eroded banks of these creeks expose accumulations of coarse gravels containing a highly visible percentage of manganese.": {}, "The reconnaissance mapping demonstrated potential for economic accumulations of detrital manganese in paleochannels beneath recent sheetwash.": {}, "None of the active or extinct drainages that crossed the manganese ridges cross the surrendered tenement sub-blocks.": {}, "7.6 XTEM Survey An XTEM survey was conducted over most of the Project area (Figure 5) which outlined a large number of conductors that were thought to represent manganese mineralization, or paleochannels that may host accumulations of detrital manganese.": {}, "The ensuing reverse circulation drilling program confirmed that the anomalies seem to originate from conductive moist clay layers, none of which produced significant manganese.": {}, "This deterred Aurora from extending the XTEM survey and pursuing detrital manganese within the outlying tenements of the Project which have since been surrendered or partially surrendered.": {}, "The results of the XTEM survey have been furnished to the Department but remain confidential due to their continued relevance to the retained portion of the Project.": {}, "Page | 15 Figure 5: Capricorn Southeast XTEM Survey Boundary Page | 16 7.7 Other Exploration Activities Base metal exploration took the form of stream sediment sampling north of the manganese ridges, where strongly folded and faulted sediments and quartz float showed secondary copper mineralisation.": {}, "The GSWA regional stream sampling data also showed weak anomalism in the area.": {}, "A program of higher density stream sediment sampling was carried out.": {}, "There were no significant geochemical anomalies deemed worthy of follow-up.": {}, "No evidence of base metal mineralisation was found in the partially surrendered tenements.": {}, "REHABILITATION No ground disturbing activity was conducted on the surrendered portions of the tenements and therefore no rehabilitation was required.": {}, "CONCLUSIONS Broad scale exploration within E52/2137; E52/2139; E09/1427 and E09/1605
