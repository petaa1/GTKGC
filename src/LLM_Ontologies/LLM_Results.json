"Thus far outcropping massive Mn and subsequent exploration has been restricted to Ullawarra Formation north of the Lyons River North Branch which, while tightly folded and faulted, overall dips northward below the younger Collier Basin sediments.": {"LLM_Results": "None"}, "Locally, the host siltstones form semi-continuous ridges striking WNW and dipping shallowly north, and are sporadically capped by surficial manganese concentration mapped by Aurora over a strike length of at least 90kms.": {"LLM_Results": "None"}, "There are regular 500- 1500m-amplitude tight folds along this strike

1-3m below the overlying dolerite.": {"LLM_Results": "None"}, "There is often an intervening chert/fine quartzite unit between the manganese and the dolerite.": {"LLM_Results": "None"}, "Some of the siltstone crops out as a flat area of interbedded shale and manganese, with the proportion of high Mn beds varying from 5-50%.": {"LLM_Results": "None"}, "This suggests that the individual unweathered siltstone layers have variable Mn content.": {"LLM_Results": "None"}, "Whilst petrological work is required on this siltstone protore ; visual evidence from RC drill chips indicate a background Mn content for the siltstone layers of 0-5%.": {"LLM_Results": "None"}, "It is the objective of Aurora to find where this has been enriched to economic grades by diagenetic, supergene or hydrothermal
